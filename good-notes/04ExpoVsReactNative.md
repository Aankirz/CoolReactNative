### What is a Framework?
A **framework** is a pre-built set of tools, libraries, and conventions that help developers build applications more efficiently by abstracting repetitive tasks. Frameworks provide predefined functionalities and components, allowing developers to focus on their application's logic instead of reinventing the wheel.

In the case of **React Native**, frameworks like **Expo** simplify and enhance the app development experience by providing:

1. **Pre-built Tools**: Expo offers tools to handle push notifications, camera access, permissions, and more.
2. **Abstracted Setup**: You donâ€™t need to configure build systems (e.g., Android Studio or Xcode) manually to start developing.
3. **Cross-Platform Development**: Build apps for both iOS and Android with a unified codebase.

### Why Use Expo?
1. **Ease of Use**: Expo abstracts much of the complexity of setting up and building React Native projects. It eliminates the need to manage native modules, making it beginner-friendly.
2. **Pre-installed Features**: It comes with APIs for common functionality like camera access, notifications, file system, etc., without additional installation.
3. **Faster Development**: With Expo Go, you can preview your app live on a physical device without compiling the code.
4. **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Expo ensures features work uniformly across Android and iOS.

### Differences When Using Expo

| **Aspect**           | **React Native CLI**                                | **Expo**                                    |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Setup**            | Manual, requires Android Studio/Xcode setup        | Simplified, no native setup needed         |
| **Customization**    | Full control over native code                      | Limited access to native modules           |
| **Pre-built Tools**  | Minimal, add libraries as needed                   | Rich built-in APIs and libraries           |
| **Build Process**    | Manual configuration for platform-specific builds  | Managed build system via Expo servers      |
| **Size of Project**  | Smaller, fewer dependencies                        | Larger due to pre-included libraries       |

### Framework Benefits in Code

#### Without a Framework:
You must manually manage native modules and boilerplate code for accessing device features.

```javascript
// React Native CLI example: Managing camera permissions
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, Button, Alert, PermissionsAndroid } from 'react-native';

const App = () => {
  const requestCameraPermission = async () => {
    try {
      const granted = await PermissionsAndroid.request(
        PermissionsAndroid.PERMISSIONS.CAMERA,
        {
          title: 'Camera Permission',
          message: 'App needs access to your camera',
        }
      );
      if (granted === PermissionsAndroid.RESULTS.GRANTED) {
        Alert.alert('You can use the camera');
      } else {
        Alert.alert('Camera permission denied');
      }
    } catch (err) {
      console.warn(err);
    }
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <Button title="Request Camera Permission" onPress={requestCameraPermission} />
    </View>
  );
};

export default App;
```

#### Using Expo:
Expo handles permissions and camera access with a single import.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { View, Button, Alert } from 'react-native';
import * as Permissions from 'expo-permissions';

const App = () => {
  const requestCameraPermission = async () => {
    const { status } = await Permissions.askAsync(Permissions.CAMERA);
    if (status === 'granted') {
      Alert.alert('You can use the camera');
    } else {
      Alert.alert('Camera permission denied');
    }
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <Button title="Request Camera Permission" onPress={requestCameraPermission} />
    </View>
  );
};

export default App;
```

### Practical Example of Expo Simplifying Code

#### Step 1: Create an Expo App
```bash
npx expo-cli init my-first-app
cd my-first-app
npm start
```

#### Step 2: Add Camera Feature Using Expo
Modify `App.js` to include a simple camera implementation.

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { View, Button, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import { Camera } from 'expo-camera';

const App = () => {
  const [hasPermission, setHasPermission] = useState(null);
  const [cameraRef, setCameraRef] = useState(null);

  const requestCameraPermission = async () => {
    const { status } = await Camera.requestPermissionsAsync();
    setHasPermission(status === 'granted');
  };

  const takePicture = async () => {
    if (cameraRef) {
      const photo = await cameraRef.takePictureAsync();
      console.log(photo);
    }
  };

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      {hasPermission === null ? (
        <Button title="Request Camera Permission" onPress={requestCameraPermission} />
      ) : hasPermission === false ? (
        <Button title="No access to camera" disabled />
      ) : (
        <Camera style={styles.camera} ref={(ref) => setCameraRef(ref)}>
          <View>
            <Button title="Take Picture" onPress={takePicture} />
          </View>
        </Camera>
      )}
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: { flex: 1, justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' },
  camera: { flex: 1, width: '100%' },
});

export default App;
```

#### Benefits:
1. **Less Code**: With Expo, camera permissions and functionality are simplified.
2. **Cross-Platform**: Code works the same for iOS and Android.
3. **Quick Testing**: Use Expo Go to run the app instantly on your phone.
